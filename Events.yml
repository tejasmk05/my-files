Push:
 This will trigger when pushed to workflow, even you can specify branch name also.on

On: push
  branches:
    - main


Pull Request:
It's not like push and it will not trigger every time, you need to mention activity type to when it need to be triggered like below.
Many activity types are there, refer Events that trigger workflows for activity types.


on:
  pull_request:
    type:  
      - opened         # this workflow will trigger when you created new pull request.
  workflow_dispatch:   # multiple events can be used in this format


Event Filters:
We don't  need run all the workflows when we pushed/.. Something, we can control using event filters


	1. Multiple branches:
	
	  push:
	    branches:
	      - main
	      - dev-*    #This will include all the branch name startes with dev eg: dev-env
	      - dev/**  #We need to ** for multiple folder like dev/name/yourname
	
	2. Paths:
	
	  push:
	    paths:
	    - '**.js'   #This worklow will run if any changes in .js files
	3. Paths-ignore:
	push:
	    paths-ignore:
	    - '**.js'   #this will ignore all js files, if any changes in js files workflow will not trigger
	
Refer Workflow syntax page for more ingo.



Skipping workflows:
If you just added small changes like comment in code and after that you don't want to re-trigger the workflow, then use below command while commiting

Git commit -m "small change" [skip ci]
